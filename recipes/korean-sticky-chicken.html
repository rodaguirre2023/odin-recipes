            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Gochugaru</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li>Rice vinegar</li>
            <li>Honey</li>
            <li>Green onion</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Just lay your boneless chicken pieces on a 
                piece of parchment paper on a solid surface.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle gochugaru (Korean red chili flakes) on top
                of the breasts and place a piece of parchment paper on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pound a few times with a rolling pin or meat tenderizer. 
                This will lock the spices on your chicken giving it a serious boost of flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pan fry the chicken in a skillet over medium to 
                medium-high heat for a few minutes until itâ€™s fully 
                cooked and transfer the pieces to a plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix remaining ingredients for the sauce in a bowl and 
                add it to the skillet. Stir and keep cooking until 
                the sauce bubbles, about 1 to 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Return the chicken to the skillet and quickly 
                toss it with the sauce to coat the pieces evenly.
            </li>
        </ol>
